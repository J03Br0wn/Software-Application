The Gaming Room was our client for this software application; They wanted to grow their user base on the popular web-based game application to include iPhone, Android, and web clients. While developing this documentation, the best thing that I did was research and development. I had no experience in Linux when I started taking this course. I now know that Ubuntu Linux has powerful tools to develop and maintain a LAMP stack web application. This research was critical to developing the application and the code; having all the information on one document was essential to finishing this project because all the notes and designs were well documented and easily accessible. If I could go back and do one thing differently on this project, it would be to decide the actual build for this project which is a LAMP stack. This way, I could focus on my development requirements and what is best for this project's server, client, and development side. I like the approach I took to designing this application using the LAMP stack because of the tools and the developer's ability to develop and maintain the front and back of the application. I think full stack development is one of the best ways to build a web application such as the Gaming room, and I look forward to learning more about this to use for future application builds
